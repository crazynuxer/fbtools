Frame buffer manipulation tools for linux, supporting frame buffer depths 16
(565), 24 (RGB), and 32 (ARGB).

Files are:

    fbclear: a python script that clears the frame buffer with an optional
    color.

    fbimage: a python script that decodes and writes a graphics image file to
    the frame buffer

    fbtext: a python script that reads text from a file or stdin, formats and
    writes it to the frame buffer.

    fb.py: a python module that provides the core functionality of fbclear,
    fbimage, and fbtext.

    fbquery.c: a utility program that reports some potentially interesting
    frame buffer info.

    fbput.c: a utility program that copies raw RGB data from stdin or file to
    the frame buffer.

    fb.c: a library that provides the access to the raw frame buffer device. It
    is compiled as a .so, invoked by fb.py, fbput and fbquery.

Run 'make' to build the eexecutables, and the fb.bin shared library.

The python code is version agnostic and will worh with python2 or python3,
although the default is python3.

Note it requires the pgmagick module to be installed for whichever version of
python will be used, e.g. via 'apt install python3-pgmagick', 'pip install
pgmagick', etc.

All scripts and programs can be run with -h option to print help.
