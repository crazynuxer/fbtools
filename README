Frame buffer manipulation tools and user interface primitives for linux,
supporting frame buffer depths 16 (565), 24 (RGB), and 32 (ARGB).

Run 'make' to build the executables, and the fb.bin shared library.

Note this requires the pgmagick module to be installed, which in turn requires
the libgraphicsmagick++ and its dependencies.

For debian/ubuntu try 'apt install python3-pgmagic'.

Executables can be run with -h option to print help.
