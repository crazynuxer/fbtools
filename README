Various Python3-based framebuffer manipulation tools and user interface
utilities with touch screen support.

Note most of this code requires PIL to be installed, on Debian-derived systems
try 'apt install python3-pil'.

After download you must run 'make' to build the framebuffer library. Then try
"./fbquery" to test it, it should report something like:

    Device:      /dev/fb0
    Width:       1920
    Height:      1080
    Bytes/pixel: 4
    Red shift:   16
    Green shift: 8
    Blue shift:  0

Utlities:

    fbcap               - write current framebuffer contents to specified image file

    fbclear             - clear the framebuffer to specified color

    fbdialog            - show a dialog with 1 to 5 buttons via framebuffer,
                          wait for one to be touched

    fbimage             - write an image file to framebuffer

    fbmenu              - show a menu with 2 to 6 selections via framebuffer,
                          wait for one to be touched (supports checkboxes and
                          radio buttons).

    fbquery             - print framebuffer information

    fbtext              - write arbitrary text to the framebuffer

    vtbind              - bind or unbind a virtual terminal from the underlying
                          framebuffer

Note if this directory is installed or symlinked to /usr/bin/python3/dist-packages
(or equivalent) then utilities can be copied elsewhere.
